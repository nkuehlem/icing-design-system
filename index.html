        <h2 class="top-margin">What are we?</h2>
        <p><strong>Classy&mdash;</strong> We are elegant and simple but not plain or stuffy(think art deco). The mods will be quick to warn/ban troublemaking users.

Extra welcoming to all by showcasing variety of sweets from across the globe.</p>
      
         <p><strong>Social&mdash;</strong> This means from all walks of life and from any region(good luck localization teams!) Our brand presence should outweigh and specific region colors.

Always be open?</p>
      
        <p><strong>Focused&mdash;</strong> Keep content relevant sweet goods.

This is our "keep it simple" visually rule.</p>
      
        <p><strong>Knowledgeable&mdash;</strong> Will it work? Does it taste good? Flawless recommendations, tips, and tricks! We will try to have ALL the answers!

        <p><strong>FUN&mdash;</strong> But not childish! This will tie our classy and social aspects together. Never scold or talk down to users. Our enthusiastic approach to everything sweet should keep our users coming back for more.</p>
